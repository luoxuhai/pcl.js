# File System

> https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/Filesystem-API.html#id2

For Example

```ts showLineNumbers
import { init, fs } from 'pcl.js';

await init();

fs.writeFile('file', 'foobar');
```

## Methods

### writeFile

```ts
writeFile(path, data, options);
```

Writes the entire contents of data to the file at path. For example:

```ts
fs.writeFile('file', 'foobar');
```

### readFile

```ts
fs.readFile(path, options);
```

Reads the entire file at path and returns it as a string (encoding is utf8), or as a new Uint8Array buffer (encoding is binary).

**Returns:**

| Type                      | Description                |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `string` or `ArrayBuffer` | The contents of the file.. |

### unlink

```ts
fs.unlink(path);
```

This removes a name from the file system. If that name was the last link to a file (and no processes have the file open) the file is deleted.

### rename

```ts
fs.rename(oldPath, newPath);
```

Renames the node at oldpath to newpath.

### mkdir

```ts
fs.mkdir(path, mode);
```

Creates a new directory node in the file system.

### rmdir

```ts
fs.rmdir(path);
```

Removes an empty directory located at path.

### readdir

```ts
fs.readdir(path);
```

Reads the entire files at path and returns it as a array. For example:

```ts showLineNumbers
const result = fs.readdir('/)
console.log(result) // ['dev', 'temp']
```
